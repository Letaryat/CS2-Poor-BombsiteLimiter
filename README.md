# CS2-Poor-BombsiteLimiter
Bombsite Limiter for CS2. Main logic is based on [CS2_BombsitesRestrict by NockyCZ](https://github.com/NockyCZ/CS2_BombsitesRestrict) with a few new functions.<br/>
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/H2H8TK0L9)

## [üõ†Ô∏è] New functions
- The plugin can draw laser beams around bombsites to indicate to players whether a bombsite is open or closed. If both bombsites are enabled, no lasers will be generated.
- Option to add a custom particle that appears at the center of a blocked bombsite and always faces the players.
- Option to add a custom point_worldtext at the center of a blocked bombsite that also faces the players.
- When PlacingMode is enabled, the plugin will generate a .json file for each map. Server owners can create entities or props to physically block access to closed bombsites. These props will automatically spawn at the start of each round if the bombsite is blocked.
- Server owners can choose to block a specific bombsite on a per-map basis.
