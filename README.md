[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/H2H8TK0L9)

## [üõ†Ô∏è] New functions
- Plugin can draw lasers around bombsites to indicate players if the bombsite is open or closed. If both bombsites are disabled, laser will be not generated.
- If PlacingMode is enabled, plugin will generate .json file for each map. Owners can create Entities / Props which will block way to get to the blocked bombsites. These props will spawn on Round Start if bombsite is blocked. 
- Possibility for server owners to block one specific bombsite depending on a map.
